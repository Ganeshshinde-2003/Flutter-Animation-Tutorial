# üé¨ Flutter Animation Tutorials
This repository contains a collection of Flutter animations created by Ganesh-Shinde for demonstration purposes. These animations are intended to provide examples of how to implement various animations in Flutter, and to serve as inspiration for your own projects.

## üé• Included Animations
### Fade Animation:
A simple animation that fades a widget in and out
### Scale Animation: 
An animation that scales a widget up and down
### Rotation Animation: 
An animation that rotates a widget continuously
### Slide Animation: 
An animation that slides a widget in and out of view
### Hero Animation: 
An animation that transitions a widget between screens using the Hero widget
### Tween Animation: 
An animation that smoothly transitions a widget's properties between two values
### Ripple Animation: 
An animation that creates a ripple effect when a user taps a widget
### Splash Screen Animation: 
An animation that displays a logo or other image while the app loads

## üöÄ How to use
To use any of these animations in your own project, simply copy the relevant code from the animation's source file and paste it into your own code. Be sure to import any necessary packages and update the animation to work with your specific project.

If you're new to Flutter animations, I recommend starting with the simpler examples and working your way up to the more complex ones. Take the time to understand how each animation works and experiment with different variations to create your own custom animations.
